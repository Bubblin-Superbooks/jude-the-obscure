His landlady brought up the supper, however, on this occasion, and he took it from her at the door.</p><p>When she had descended he set the teapot on the hob, and drew out Sue's clothes anew; but they were far from dry. A thick woollen gown, he found, held a deal of water. So he hung them up again, and enlarged his fire and mused as the steam from the garments went up the chimney.</p><p>Suddenly she said, "Jude!"</p><p>"Yes. All right. How do you feel now?"</p><p>"Better. Quite well. Why, I fell asleep, didn't I? What time is it? Not late surely?"</p><p>"It is past ten."</p><p>"Is it really? What <em>shall</em> I do!" she said, starting up.</p><p>"Stay where you are."</p></div> </div>
