I did not exactly flirt with you; but that inborn craving which undermines some women's morals almost more than unbridled passion—the craving to attract and captivate, regardless of the injury it may do the man—was in me; and when I found I had caught you, I was frightened. And then—I don't know how it was—I couldn't bear to let you go—possibly to Arabella again—and so I got to love you, Jude. But you see, however fondly it ended, it began in the selfish and cruel wish to make your heart ache for me without letting mine ache for you."</p><p>"And now you add to your cruelty by leaving me!"</p><p>"Ah—yes! The further I flounder, the more harm I do!"</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"O Sue!" said he with a sudden sense of his own</p></div> </div>
