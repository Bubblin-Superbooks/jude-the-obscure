I don't want to be bothered with it. I have a sort of affection for a little of it that belonged to my poor mother and father.

It is now a quarter to six."</p><p>"You… You don't seem very sorry I am going, Richard!"</p><p>"Oh no—perhaps not."</p><p>"I like you much for how you have behaved. It is a curious thing that directly I have begun to regard you as not my husband, but as my old teacher, I like you. I won't be so affected as to say I love you, because you know I don't, except as a friend. But you do seem that to me!"</p></div> </div>
