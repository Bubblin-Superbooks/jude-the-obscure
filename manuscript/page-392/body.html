<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">my little friend Sue recently. It occurred to me to speak to you on that account. I merely want to ask—about her."</p><p>"I think I know what!" Jude hurriedly said. "About her escaping from the training school, and her coming to me?"</p><p>"Yes."</p><p>"Well"—Jude for a moment felt an unprincipled and fiendish wish to annihilate his rival at all cost. By the exercise of that treachery which love for the same woman renders possible to men the most honourable in every other relation of life, he could send off Phillotson in agony and defeat by saying that the scandal was true, and that Sue had irretrievably committed herself with him. But his action did not respond for a moment to his animal instinct; and what he said was, "I am glad of your kindness in coming to talk plainly to me about it. You know what they say?—that I ought to marry her."</p></div> </div>
