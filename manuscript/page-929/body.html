No reflection on you, my dear. It is a mere rhetorical figure—what they call in the books, hyperbole."</p><p>"Keep your figures for your debts to friends who shelter you," said Donn.</p><p>"If I am bound in honour to marry her—as I suppose I am—though how I came to be here with her I know no more than a dead man—marry her I will, so help me God! I have never behaved dishonourably to a woman or to any living thing. I am not a man who wants to save himself at the expense of the weaker among us!"</p><p>"There—never mind him, deary," said she, putting her cheek against Jude's. "Come up and wash your face, and just put yourself tidy, and off we'll go. Make it up with Father."</p></div> </div>
