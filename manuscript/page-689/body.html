The latter drew back and turned to her lover, her mouth shaping itself like that of a child about to give way to grief:</p><p>"Jude—I don't like it here! I wish we hadn't come! The place gives me the horrors: it seems so unnatural as the climax of our love! I wish it had been at church, if it had to be at all. It is not so vulgar there!"</p><p>"Dear little girl," said Jude. "How troubled and pale you look!"</p><p>"It must be performed here now, I suppose?"</p><p>"No—perhaps not necessarily."</p><p>He spoke to the clerk, and came back. "No—we need not marry here or anywhere, unless we like, even now," he said. "We can be married in a church, if not with the same certificate with another he'll give us, I think. Anyhow, let us go out till you are calmer, dear, and I too, and talk it over."</p></div> </div>
