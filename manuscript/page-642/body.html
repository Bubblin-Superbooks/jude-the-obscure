"Oh, I knew I could trust you!—how good you are!"—she began.</p><p>"I can't find her anywhere in this street, and I went out in my slippers only. She has walked on, thinking I've been so hard-hearted as to refuse her requests entirely, poor woman. I've come back for my boots, as it is beginning to rain."</p><p>"Oh, but why should you take such trouble for a woman who has served you so badly!" said Sue in a jealous burst of disappointment.</p><p>"But, Sue, she's a woman, and I once cared for her; and one can't be a brute in such circumstances."</p><p>"She isn't your wife any longer!" exclaimed Sue, passionately excited. "You <em>mustn't</em> go out to find her! It isn't right! You <em>can't</em> join her, now she's a stranger to you. How can you forget such a thing, my dear, dear one!"</p></div> </div>
