A timid knock sounded upon the door of his abode.</p><p>It was evening—so he was at home; and by a species of divination he jumped up and rushed to the door himself.</p><p>"Will you come out with me? I would rather not come in. I want to—to talk with you—and to go with you to the cemetery."</p><p>It had been in the trembling accents of Sue that these words came. Jude put on his hat. "It is dreary for you to be out," he said. "But if you prefer not to come in, I don't mind."</p><p>"Yes—I do. I shall not keep you long."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Jude was too much affected to go on talking at first;</p></div> </div>
